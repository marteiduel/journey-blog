      </p>
      <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
      <p>
        As the IT Manager at Alta Design and Construction, I exhibited a strong
        capability in IT and cross-departmental management, handling not just
        technical responsibilities, but also overseeing the alignment of
        strategic goals across the marketing and customer service teams. With a
        unique blend of leadership skills and technical expertise, I supervised
        a team of 4, while also coordinating the efforts of the marketing and
        customer service teams, creating a more unified and productive work
        environment. I worked without supervision, adapting to the rapidly
        changing needs of a growing company, developing new workflows and
        processes as the company expanded its services in multiple languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical portfolio at Alta was vast, encompassing both front-end and
        back-end development, as well as the development of custom automation
        scripts using Python and JavaScript. I have substantial experience
        working with various software like Google Analytics, Mosaiac API, Moxo,
        Jotmforms, Clicksend, Lucid chart, Builder Trend, SolarNexus, Calendly,
        Google Drive API, Postman, App Script, Hostinger, and various custom and
        external APIs such as Lending Tree and Google Sheets API. My work with
        VPSs and custom Python scripts has been crucial in integrating services
        and automating processes, boosting efficiency significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond executing development tasks, my role extended to decision-making
        around the software infrastructure of the organization. I was
        responsible for determining what software the company would use and
        ensured we adopted tools that would increase productivity and reduce
        costs. In my relentless pursuit of cost-efficiency, I always sought ways
        to save money without compromising on functionality or efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key part of my role involved website development and implementing
        effective SEO practices. I was instrumental in building the company's
        website and transitioned the company's domain during a significant
        restructuring phase. My work ensured that our online presence was
        strong, our site was functional and attractive, and our pages were
        optimized for search engine visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        My emphasis on fast and efficient client communication drove the
        creation of a custom system that offered clients real-time updates on
        their projects. I also collaborated with the marketing team to develop a
        strategy that emphasized rapid communication through text, email, or
        calls. This approach ensured that our customer service and sales teams
        worked with "warm leads," resulting in higher conversion rates.
        Furthermore, I handled the administration of the Google Workspace
        account, managing access across the organization, proving my adeptness
        at balancing technical and operational roles.

      </p>
      <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
      <p>
        In my role at FreeAgent CRM, I demonstrated a strong proficiency in both
        technical and client-oriented tasks. I was actively involved in customer
        service, interacting with customers daily, and often dealing with

        budget-friendly solutions. This experience was further enriched through
        a cross-cultural collaboration project in Mexico, where I helped to
        design processes for our newly formed Coding Professional Services
        branch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical tasks encompassed developing automation and workflows, working
        closely with the Customer Support team to address customer issues, and
        crafting custom code for specific customer needs. I diligently
        maintained a comprehensive record of customer and internal issues via a
        ticket application and provided internal technical support to staff. My
        familiarity with AWS API Gateway, Lambda functions, and CloudWatch
        further augmented my capacity to troubleshoot and resolve issues
        effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having served as a Level 2 Technical Support at a SaaS company for over
        two years, I'm equipped with substantial knowledge of software
        methodologies, tools, and processes. This expertise, combined with my
        proficiency in Javascript, Python, SQL, and CRM systems, allowed me to
        adapt quickly to dynamic requirements in a fast-paced environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My commitment to excellent customer service and the continuous drive for
        improving business operations have consistently guided my actions. This
        includes always seeking the most efficient and effective solutions for
        problems, keeping in mind client's requirements and budgets. My fluency
        in English, both verbal and written, enables seamless communication with
        various stakeholders, helping me bridge the gap between technical and
        non-technical individuals. I pride myself on being a reliable and
        valuable technical resource, ready to tackle any challenge and
        contribute positively to a team.

        Queries, Custom API, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, customer service
      </p>
      <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
      <p>
        Working on this global software development project was more than just a
        job; it was a thrilling adventure. Imagine, all of us developers from
        around the world, collaborating on one project, speaking the universal
        language of code. We were like an orchestra, each instrument with its
        unique sound, together creating a symphony. In this ensemble, I played
        the ReactJs and JavaScript notes, intricately intertwined with a harmony
        of other technologies like React Spring, CSS, Tailwind, and Redux.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being the project's sole representative from the U.S. felt like having
        my solo on stage. I had the responsibility of quick fixes that cropped
        up during U.S. hours and made sure our tune didn't miss a beat. It was
        an experience that taught me the value of autonomy, and trust me,
        nothing beats the feeling of a bug-free code after a good day's work.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the unique aspects of this project was how closely we
        collaborated with the design team. Picture us, designers and developers
        huddled together, brainstorming, sharing ideas, and, of course, spotting
        potential design issues even before the coding began. This collaborative
        approach helped us avoid the infamous back-and-forth dance between
        design and development, keeping our progress smooth and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adopting the Agile methodology, we were like a relay team, each one of
        us delivering our part on time, passing the baton smoothly. I always
        aimed to finish my sprint a little early, which gave me a chance to
        support other team members when needed. This collaborative culture
        turned our daily scrum meetings into a friendly gathering where we
        celebrated achievements, planned our next steps, and prepared for any
        hurdles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best part? We managed to provide round-the-clock customer support,
        thanks to our international team. Besides writing application interface
        codes, I had the chance to wear many hats - monitoring front-end
        performance, debugging, and troubleshooting. Overall, this project was
        not just about coding; it was about teamwork, leadership, and delivering
        excellence to our users. Each day was a new learning experience, and I
        believe that's what makes one a better developer.

        HTML, CSS, UI/UX, SQL, Postman
      </p>
      <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
      <p>
        Hungry Budget was conceived to address the common problem of finding
        affordable food. Leveraging my expertise in UI/UX design, I created
        prototypes using Figma. Evaluating each design's merits and drawbacks, I
        proceeded to develop the app. Built with React JS, JavaScript, PHP,
        HTML, CSS, Redux, and my own API, Hungry Budget enables users to
        effortlessly find budget-friendly breakfast, dinner, or dessert options
        in their city.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the dedicated three-month development phase, I not only focused
        on creating a seamless user experience but also implemented a feature
        allowing restaurants to manage the dishes displayed from their
        establishments. To enhance the app's effectiveness and user
        satisfaction, I conducted comprehensive field marketing studies. These
        studies provided valuable insights that guided me in refining the app's
        performance and delivering an exceptional user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hungry Budget stands as a testament to my capabilities as a full-stack
        developer. From conceptualizing the UI/UX design to conducting marketing
        field studies and coding the app, I assumed various roles, gaining
        valuable insights into all aspects of app development. Additionally, I
        developed a Python script capable of scraping restaurant menus, allowing
        the app to obtain data from the most reliable sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building Hungry Budget taught me valuable lessons in planning and
        collaboration. As the project progressed, I discovered unforeseen
        complexities and challenges, reinforcing the importance of anticipating
        potential issues and involving diverse perspectives early on. While the
        current code may require further scalability, this experience equipped
        me with invaluable knowledge for future endeavors, emphasizing the
        significance of comprehensive planning and effective collaboration in
        app development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the process of building Hungry Budget, I not only became a
        better developer but also grew as a team member. Recognizing the
        collective effort required to deliver a scalable and user-friendly app,
        I have transformed into a conscientious and collaborative team member.
        This experience has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the value of
        teamwork, driving me to contribute effectively to future projects and
        deliver exceptional experiences for end-users.

      </p>
      <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
      <p>
        Hungry Budget Admin Panel is a full-stack solo project built using
        ReactJS for the frontend and PHP for the backend. It utilizes Redux or
        Context for state management and ensures a smooth user interface (UI)
        and user experience (UX). The application's database is powered by
        myphpadmin and hosted on Hostigner, enabling efficient data management
        using SQL. User authentication is implemented to ensure secure access,
        and HTML and CSS contribute to the application's functionality and
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The admin panel provides real-time data display for restaurants,
        allowing them to monitor the performance of their dishes on the Hungry
        Budget app. Through analytics and statistics, restaurant owners can gain
        insights into dish popularity and make informed decisions about their
        menu offerings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restaurant owners can easily manage their business's basic information,
        such as name, address, and logo, through the admin panel. This
        functionality ensures that the restaurant's details are always up to
        date and accurately represented on the Hungry Budget platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The admin panel grants granular control over the dishes displayed on
        Hungry Budget. Restaurant owners can modify various aspects of each
        dish, including name, description, price, and picture. This flexibility
        allows them to quickly respond to customer feedback, adapt to changing
        trends, and effectively market their dishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The admin panel provides a dedicated subdomain for each restaurant,
        facilitating seamless integration between their website and the Hungry
        Budget platform. Additionally, restaurant owners can easily upload new
        dishes and remove existing ones, ensuring that their menu remains up to
        date on the Hungry Budget app.

        Marketing
      </p>
      <h2>Responsibilities:</h2>
      <p>
        When I began my collaboration with Master Stylist, a local hair salon,
        from February 9, 2022, to January 24, 2023, the business was primarily
        brick-and-mortar with minimal online presence. Over this period, I built
        a robust digital platform for them that attracted 1,258 users, more than
        half of which came from organic search. This new online presence,
        combined with data-driven marketing strategies, resulted in a 20%
        increase in sales, highlighting the impact of a well-planned digital
        transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner of the salon was not tech-inclined, which presented a unique
        challenge. It was essential to communicate the potential benefits of a
        digital presence in a way she could understand. Over time, through
        patience and clear explanations, she began to see the value of the
        digital world for her business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating the salon's online identity involved building a website on
        WordPress, hosted by Hostinger. I designed a custom WordPress theme that
        was ADA compliant and resonated with the salon's brand image. A
        considerable effort was put into the website's SEO to increase its
        visibility and attract potential customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website was more than just an online business card; it was a source
        of valuable data. With the help of Google Analytics, I gathered insights
        about user behavior and used this information to develop targeted
        marketing strategies. The shift from a general marketing approach to a
        data-driven one proved to be highly effective, maximizing the return on
        marketing investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of our collaboration, the salon's owner had not only seen the
        benefits of digital transformation but also felt empowered to manage her
        own digital presence. While I continue to be a trusted advisor, it's
        inspiring to see her confidently navigate her digital journey. This
        project stands as a testament to my ability to drive digital
        transformation, communicate effectively with diverse audiences, and
        deliver tangible results.
